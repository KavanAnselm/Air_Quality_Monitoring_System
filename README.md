This project is an IoT-based Air Quality Monitoring System designed to track environmental parameters such as gas concentration, temperature, and humidity in real time. Built using the ESP8266 microcontroller, MQ135 gas sensor, and DHT11 temperature/humidity sensor, the system provides live data to both a 16x2 LCD display and the Blynk IoT platform.

**Key Features:**

Real-time monitoring of air quality, temperature, and humidity.

ESP8266 handles sensor data and connects to Blynk Cloud for mobile/web access.

Visual alerts on LCD display and push notifications via the Blynk app.

Suitable for indoor environments like homes, offices, or labs.

**Technologies Used:**

Hardware: ESP8266, MQ135, DHT11, LCD Display with I2C, Breadboard

Software: Arduino IDE, Blynk IoT Platform, C/C++ (Arduino)
